# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (à la bit.ly). Sort of like TinyURL, but not really.

Note from author:
Changes and features are still to be implemented as this is not the final version. I do hope you enjoy it.
Sincerely,
Bryan G.
